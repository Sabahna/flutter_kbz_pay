### Unresolved Reference xxx Error

When you `open for Editing in Android Studio`, Android Studio will download required libraries
including gradle. After that, everything will be fine and you can import flutter packages.
Sometimes, Android Studio will show error `Unresolved reference xxx`, xxx means your flutter
packages. **In this case, you should delete gradle caches, do
again `open for Editing in Android Studio` and it will download itself. Now, everything is normal.**

## iOS

In `ios/xxx.podspec`, you need configurations to integrate with Vendor Framework,

**Let's assume you are using only one vendor framework and your folder structure is like that -**

<pre>
.
â””â”€â”€ plugin/
    â”œâ”€â”€ example/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ ios/
        â””â”€â”€ xxxxxx.xcframework
</pre>

`xxxxxx` means your vendor framework name.
In this situation, you can integrate your podspec below that

```podspec
  s.preserve_paths = 'xxxxxx.xcframework/**/*'
  s.xcconfig = { 'OTHER_LDFLAGS' => '-framework xxxxxx','ENABLE_BITCODE' => 'NO' }
  s.vendored_frameworks = 'xxxxxx.xcframework'
```

**Or if you are using many vendor frameworks and so you can integrate folder structure like -**

<pre>
.
â””â”€â”€ plugin/
    â”œâ”€â”€ example/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â””â”€â”€ ios/
        â””â”€â”€ Frameworks/
            â”œâ”€â”€ xxxxxx.xcframework
            â””â”€â”€ yyyyyy.xcframework
</pre>

```podspec
   s.preserve_paths = 'Frameworks/**/**/*'
   s.vendored_frameworks = 'Frameworks/**'
```

`If you know Swift, you can also convert Objective-C code to Swift by using` [converter](https://okaxaki.github.io/objc2swift/demo.html)

**`If your Vendor Framework is writing with Objective-C and your plugin of language is Swift, some methods and names are overrided and renamed because of Swift Compiler.`You should learn about `Swift Style Guide`**

**How To Open Flutter Plugin in Xcode**

```shell
# Root of your plugin directory
cd example

flutter build ios --no-codesign # flutter build ios

# And, open example of Xcode project
cd ios && open Runner.xcworkspace
```

In Xcode,
<pre>
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Runner
â””â”€â”€ Pods/
    â”œâ”€â”€ Podfile
    â””â”€â”€ Development Pods/
        â””â”€â”€ your_plugin_name/
            â””â”€â”€ ../
                â””â”€â”€ ../
                    â””â”€â”€ example/
                        â””â”€â”€ ios/
                            â””â”€â”€ .symlinks/
                                â””â”€â”€ plugins/
                                    â””â”€â”€ your_plugin_name/
                                        â””â”€â”€ ios/
                                            â””â”€â”€ Classes/
                                                â””â”€â”€ YourPlugin.swift
</pre>

Now, you are ready to code plugin.
